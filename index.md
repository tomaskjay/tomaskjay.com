# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tomas.

### I'm a student at Case Western Reserve University pursuing a BA in computer science.
<br>

This is just a blog where I post some thoughts about trips I've taken, movies, books, and other random things I find interesting. 

It was made using Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub Pages.
