## Where I'm from
I was born and raised in the suburbs of Edina, Minnesota. I was fortunate enough to go to The Blake School from middle school to high school. Grew up playing lots of tennis and spending too much time on the internet. 

## Where I am now
Right now, I'm a junior at CWRU studying computer science. Besides classes, I enjoy exploring the Cleveland area, staying in shape, having conversations with strangers, helping to run the school's pickleball club, and competing with my friends on the NYT mini and connections.
