Before I found this in the office of a place I was staying in, I'd seen reviews that this was Michael Lewis's best book yet.
After having read it, I wouldn't disagree with them. I always put the book down wishing I could read another chapter, and felt
that Lewis did an awesome job of making the lives and careers of two famous _psychologists_ seem exciting and dynamic.
