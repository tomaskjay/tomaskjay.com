Alongside _Understanding Power_ as the book that has most blown my mind. 
After reading _Debt_ I don't know how money, debt, and economics _should_ work,
but I do know now that they don't work at all like the dominant cultural narratives
say they do, and that is an incredible valuable lesson.

Thank you, David Graeber.
