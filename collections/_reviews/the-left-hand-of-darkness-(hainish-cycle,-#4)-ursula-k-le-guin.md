Le Guin was out there in the 60s putting radical gender politics into a science fiction genre that
more often was concerned with using aliens and future-tech to construct elaborate and self-excusing
rape fantasies. I agree with Harold Bloom that this book of Le Guin's elevated the entire genre, and
is possibly the best written and most imaginative novel in a genre of exceedingly imaginative novels.
