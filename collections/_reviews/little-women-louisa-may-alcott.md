Adorable, warm, restorative. David Foster Wallace is possibly the person most associated with calling out
how irony-poisoned and insincere contemporary 21st society has become, and I'd bet he'd prescribe
a dose of _Little Women_ is you'd finished all of [_Cheers_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheers) and still
found you'd couldn't really believe in yourself, love, and others.
