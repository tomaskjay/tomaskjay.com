I'm one of the _Dune_ newbies that picked up the book because they got hyped by the 2020 movie adaption trailer.
"I better read this before the movie comes out in November 2020!" I thought. Well, COVID fucked that all up and now I've
got time to read the whole series about ten times over before the film comes out. Anyways, reviewing the book...

_Dune_ is bloody amazing. I wouldn't call myself a science fiction fan, but I saw that this was regarded as possibly
the greated in the genre. "Greatest of all time? This might be good. I might love this."

I don't want to do the book a disservice by rushing out a shit revie, so for now I'll just say that I loved how Herbert
took an epic hero's journey story and a superhero origin story and set it in an incredibly well imagined far-future setting.
Paul, a teenager, loses everything and wins it all back spectacularly while acquiring superhuman abilities. A story about a
teenage boy winning everything and getting superhuman abilities could be lame and immature, but Herbert is throughout the 
whole book weaving the idea that Paul's superhuman abilities will doom him.
