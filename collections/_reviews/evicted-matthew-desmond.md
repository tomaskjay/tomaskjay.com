My favourite podcast is _The Ezra Klein Show_, and at the end of each episode Klein gets his guest to give three
books that they'd recommend to the audience. [u/PossionsRevenge](https://www.reddit.com/user/PoissonsRevenge/) posted on Reddit
a spreadsheet counting the mentioned books, and _Evicted_ was [easily the most recommended book from guests.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfYxNPMmIwMp_g6qpKbtAlzGhiykWggVC9Oe5RenfE3S9vb1ZiSll-30uVa8Ea3bJwycIbWka6nX97/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true)

I saw this and was like, "damn, I've got to read this book."

I have now read the book, and it is fantastic, and it is _brutal_. This story of "poverty and profit" in the USA is deeply sad, infuriating,
and disgusting. I feel like the struggles Desmond chronicles in this book have been scarred on my brain. It hurt me to connect even a little 
with the characters Desmond so competently shares with us.

Read this book, I implore you.
