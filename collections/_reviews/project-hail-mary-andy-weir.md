_(This review contains spoilers)_

I read most of Hail Mary between the hours of 2am and 9am, having most uncharacteristically woken up in the
middle of the night and failed to get back to sleep. I'm not sure if this unusual reading situation made me
like the book more or less than I should have, but I did overall like this book and find it entertaining the
whole way through its almost 500 pages.

_Project Hail Mary_ is a near-future science fiction story with hard-science aesthetics and aliens. Like _The Martian_
it involves a single male protoganist in a lonely and crazy situation, but it is far, far, far superior to that predecessor book (more on that later).

This was the first Andy Weir book I read, having only sampled his work via the movie adaption of _The Martian_ (which is great.) I did not expect the writing
to be good, and it was not good, but passable. I expected the protoganist to have a kind of annoying personality, like _The Martian's_ Mark Watney did, and
Ryland Grace the protagonist did indead have an annoying personality. Finally, I expected the book to spend too much time focused on science-problem exposition
and not enough actually telling a compelling story, and its true that much of the book reads like _and-this-then-this-then-this_ puzzle solving.
But I still liked the book. Once the endearing and interesting alien comes into the picture, the book balances cool-science-shit against actual drama and is
better for it. The genuine enthusiasm that Andy Weir brings to the page is also infectious and applaudable; science is extremely cool and more novels
should advance its coolness. By the end, I cared about the fates of each main character and was satisfied with their arc. I also look forward to the movie
adaption which apparently has secured Ryan Gosling as lead.

This review is dated Dec' 2021 because that's when I finished the book, but I am actually writing this short review in Dec' _2022_, a couple of weeks after
I picked up and finished Weir's first book, _The Martian_. Holy shit that book sucked. It contains the worst prose and character development that I've read
in many years. The main character, Watney, is gratingly juvenile and chipper. His dumb wise-cracks wouldn't be amusing in an actual young adult fiction book
about a high school senior, but in a book about an astronaut that is left to die alone on Mars the attitude Weir gives his main character is absurd.

If you're the kind of person that only reads highly-recommended and awarded books, take a quick dive into _The Martian_ to be reminded what awful writing
looks like, and then retreat to Steinbeck or Houellebecq or whatever with a renewed appreciate. _The Martian_ is a 1-star novel, totally rotten, but _Project Hail Mary_
shows Weir has improved as an author, and I'd say it just does enough to certify fresh.
