I picked up this book on the recommendation of [a friend](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/87941383-matthew-wallis). It was a strange
and challenging read, and I most appreciated the ambiguous treatment of the narrator protoganist. At several places in the book I hit a
moment of identification with the old steppenwolf, and I wasn't sure whether these identifications meant I was being indirectly condemned
and mocked by the author. Is the steppenwolf and admirable man, or is he a joke? Or is judgment of the protoganist entirely besides the point
and Hesse instead wants me to think about the psychological analysis of an aging man in an age that's past him by (into better or worse things?)

I was interested almost the whole time, but I don't think I really get it, and thus I couldn't love it.
