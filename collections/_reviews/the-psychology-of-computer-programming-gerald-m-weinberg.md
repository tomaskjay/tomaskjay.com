I'd maybe recommend skimming this book, or reading the intro, which is great, but I wouldn't bother
reading it carefully and for a long time. The insights have aged poorly over the decades; they're either
banal or probably invalidated by changes in software development practices. The writing is kind of tedious,
and the personality of the author that comes through is a little unpleasant.

I can believe that this book was highly influential in its time, and was geniunely important information to
desseminate amongst a programmer workforce still acquinted with punch cards and fridge-sized mainframes.
But in 2021, it's not much to write home about.
