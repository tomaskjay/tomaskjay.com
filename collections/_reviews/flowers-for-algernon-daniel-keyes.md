This book is a remarkable journey. The author, Daniel Keyes, does a wonderful job
using prose to track the increasing and decreasing intelligence of the protagonist,
and the central theme of the book, I think about the relationship between kindness, intelligence, and
loneliness, is a knockout.

I'd heard that this was a top-tier tear-jerker, so expected to be a weeping mess at the end,
but I may have spent all my tears at the ending of _The Nickel Boys_ which I'd finished a couple weeks
prior. Still, the final page hits hard, and this book is overall one of the most life affirming stories
I've ever read.
