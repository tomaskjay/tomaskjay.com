This is one of the most recommended books by _Ezra Klein Show_ guests, so I picked it up.
Overall, I thought it was great. Its central theme is growing old about being 'beaten up' by time.
The book follows a number of characters, some over decades, and I loved when Egan smashed some character's hopeful,
expanding youth by neighbouring it on the page with their horrible future. I remember her detailing the personality
and circumstances of a ~14 year old girl, and then right after offering a paragraph describing the tragedy of their 30s.
It hit appropriately hard.

The prose is great. The characters and their rock music subculture are great. Really solid book.
