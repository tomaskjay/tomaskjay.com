A wonderful book. Science fiction has made be laugh (Douglas Adams) and thrilled me (Herbert, Stephenson) but this book by Le Guin
is the first to really wrest out my feelings. Reading Le Guin's beautifully complicated and honest accounting of a anarchist society
was eye-opening in exactly the way science fiction should be. She put our old and terrestial political strife on far-future planets
and helped me see better what discarding a capitalist life could actually be like: impoverished and frustrating, but not degrading, unhappy, or unfair,
precisely the opposite.
