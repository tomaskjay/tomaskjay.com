I picked this book up because it was recommended, directly or indirectly, by Peter Thiel. I've been
interested in his life philosophy for a while, and life extension is a topic worthy of more attention.

Unfortunately this book sucked. The structure of the book is awful. It meanders about in a 'and this, and this, and this'
kind of way. The prose is awful, reading like a something a B-average college student would put out because they _have to_.
Finally, the arguments and insights in the book are notably boring, given the wondrous technology being discussed.
Talking about a world in which humans live to over 150 years old, and reach 'middle age' around 80, the most interesting
avenues of exploration to the reader are stuff like the possibility of having two careers.

Comfortably the worst book I read in 2021.
