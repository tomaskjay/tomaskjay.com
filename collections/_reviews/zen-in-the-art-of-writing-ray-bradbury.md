I'm not a great fan of Bradbury's writing, but I'd like to one day write science fiction short stories and Bradbury
is the only science fiction author that I know to have written a book about his science fiction writing process.

Well, in this short book Bradbury is wonderfully energetic, enthusiastic and humble. He made me feel more that writing
should be fun — it should! — and that I could progress in the craft by following his positivity and processes.
