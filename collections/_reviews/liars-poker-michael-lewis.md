I wanted to read this because I'm a big fan of the movies adapted from Michael Lewis's work (The Big Short, Moneyball)
and because I really liked _The Big Short_ (book) and thought it was important work. _Liar's Poker_ is the breakout first
book by Lewis, and I definitely enjoyed it less than the three other books of his that I've read.

I was certainly curious about the 80s investment banking culture that it depicts going in, but it didn't hold my interest.
Turns out the 2008 financial crisis (the focus of _The Big Short_) is a more interesting topic than the drama and office politics of
80s investment banks, and Jim Clark (central in _The New New Thing_) is a much more interesting character than anyone found within
the pages of _Liar's Poker_. 

I may have also liked it less because I find the book's characters, the investment bankers with their money obsessed amorality, pretty
unpleasant. They were, almost as a rule, bullying, greedy, chauvinistic, and duplicitous.
