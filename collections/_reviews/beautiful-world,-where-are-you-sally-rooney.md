Not much to say about this one. I enjoyed it, but it hasn't stayed with me.
I got a bit sick of the two main characters by the end. Despite basically agreeing
with everything they write in their emails to each other, it was all a bit too much
whinging about the dis-empowered, dissatisfying life of a contemporary progressive.
