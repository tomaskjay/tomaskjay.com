This book is a business management classic, and I'd say has been incredibly influential in the corporate technology sector.
I'd read the Wikipedia page for Clayton M. Christensen's ["Disruptive Innovation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation) which
details breifly most of the ideas contained in _The Innovator's Dilemma_ but wanted to go to the primary source.

I didn't love reading this book. It's detailed, methodical, and sober. But it's ideas are so influential and I think so powerful that
I gave it 5 stars. It's a must-read.

I asked the engineers at work if they'd heard of this "famous mormon" and his book, and got no affirmative replies, so
_The Innovator's Dilemma_ might be underappreciated within software circles, given that it's ideas have become 'the water we swim in'.
