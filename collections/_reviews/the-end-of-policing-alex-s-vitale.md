Somehow this book got on my 'Want To Read' list, and was then gifted to me for my birthday in 2019.
It became a 'must read' during the June 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, and I eventually finished it later that year.

Overall it's a well done argument that lays out USA police forces' incredibly racist origin stories, their current
ineptitude at fulfilling their stated social function ("the best kept secret of police is that they don't prevent crime"), 
and their possible disappearing from our future societies.

It pretty easy to parse, and short, so should be required reading for those adopting the "defund the police is a terrible idea" hot take.
