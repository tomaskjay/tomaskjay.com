This is a collection of essays from the tech industry famous [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/). If you
frequent Hackernews you've very likely read some of them before.

In short, the essays that a focused predominantly on software are great, and the essays that see Graham offering
his opinions on culture and politics are bad. At times he's downright insufferable. He calls Noam Chomsky a "professional controversialist".
What mate? The father of modern linguistics, who originated the Chomsky-Schützenberger Hierarchy of grammars, which underpins your favourite
programming language, LISP, is a professional controversialist? Comeon.
