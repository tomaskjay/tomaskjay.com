It's possibly a bit embarrassing how much art, literature, and poetry I've become engaged with because it was
feature in a James Bond movie. Well, I'm sorry, but I finally got into Jack London after one of his quotes was used
at the end of _No Time To Die_:

> ‚ÄúThe proper function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time.‚Äù

Soon after exiting the cinema I jumped on his Wikipedia page, reminding myself that _The Call of the Wild_ was his most famous book,
and bought it soon after.

This was December 2021, and I write this review one year later. My memory of reading the book is that by the end I absolutely loved
Buck the protoganist dog and came away thinking, and saying to others, "dogs are awesome, aren't they? Yes, they're awesome."

Definitely read this book, and then get an awesome dog. If you have one, get another, or get one for someone else.
