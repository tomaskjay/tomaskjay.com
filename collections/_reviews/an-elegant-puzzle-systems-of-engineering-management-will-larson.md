I'm giving this book three stars because I can see myself returning over and over again to this
book to sanity check my thinking about something at work. It's got a lot of simply written, simply structured
'how to do this' type sections. 

I wanted to give it two stars though, because on the whole I didn't really like it. To summarise, its worst features are:

- **Incomprehensible diagrams.** Some are so hard to understand I felt annoyed with the author and editor that I was subjected to them. I've linked Vicki Boykis' review below which details most of the terrible diagrams.
- **Messy structure.** Really shows that Will Larson drafted this book by sticking together existing blog posts.
- **Too high-level.** Larson must have plenty of interesting war stories, and they would have grounded his pie-in-the-sky prescriptions.  

For a longer review that I wholly endorse, see [Do we need tech management books?](https://vicki.substack.com/p/do-we-need-tech-management-books) by Vicki Boykis.
