This novel is probably the most venerated in the software industry and I'm glad to say it actually lives up
to its reputation. It's a wild, ridiculous ride, full of ideas that you know the author thinks are really interesting
but also often worthy of ridicule and satirizing. _Snow Crash_ must have been a real shot in the arm when it was read in
1992, before a lot of the science fiction technology contained actually starting to be realized in the world, and much less for
fun than for balance sheets.

Before reading _Snow Crash_ (1992) I read _The Diamond Age_ (1995). I really like the latter but I love the former. This book
is a classic, and I'd bet than in 2050 when we're more significantly living in the machine that the tech industry built
this book will be revered even by tweedy English literature folks as a classic of its age.
