Because I myself really like the problems surrounding Machine Learning and want to 'get into' ML myself, I've thought a lot and read a lot about the challenge of breaking into the field. Because I'm also a moderator of r/learnmachinelearning and one of my responsibilities is Wiki contribution, I put all this reading and thinking to use and wrote multiple guides on the subject.

The key point of difference of my guides to others is that's there's multiple of them. When people write guides for 'getting into ML', they typically take only one sense of what ML is. Does it mean working in Industry, or working as a researcher? Does it mean writing the SparkML framework or building a hotdog recogniser on the weekend? I hope that in recognising this probelm with the current guides, I've written a set of guides that together may satisfy the requirements of any person interested in ML and not currently 'doing it'.

## Introduction: How to get into Machine Learning

Seems almost like everyone and their nana wants to 'do Machine Learning' these days. The following guides have been written to be used and re-used when we get the X00th person in r/learnmachinelearning asking “how do I get into ML? Where do I start?” Or “what does it take to get a job in ML?”

There is more than one guide because it has been the experience of the author that not everyone is seeking the same things from Machine Learning work.

When possible, these guides have stuck closely to the views of established Machine Learning engineers and researchers. In other places, the author has forwards their view of things. Please feel free to submit feedback and improvements for these any parts of these guides.

## Getting into ML: High Schoolers Guide

Your still in high school and you’re thinking about doing Machine Learning? Awesome! My high school days were mostly concerned with Pokémon and Call of Duty, so I applaud your initiative. There are two kinds of high schoolers that ask how to get into ML. Those who want to build fun projects in their spare time, and those who are angling for a future career in the industry. For the former, the [Hacker Guide](https://somewhere.com) is suitable. For the latter, continue on.

If you want to do Machine Learning as a career, you will almost certainly be heading to college/university in the future. If Machine Learning is the goal, the most important committment you can make today is the commitment to your current studies. Excellent academic performance now will give you the best chance of opportunities at world-leading academic institutions. Whether your heading for the SATs, GCSEs, ATARs, whatever, make sure you do your best.

**What university courses to consider**

Machine Learning is mathematics first, and programming second. Machine Learning research is currently (and likely in future) dominated by PHD graduates in Physics, Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. Undergraduate studies in a *quantitative discipline* like mathematics, statistics, or physics will probably best place you for research in the Machine Learning field. If you are less concerned with research and more interested in Machine Learning software engineering, those former areas a *still* valuable (learn coding on the side), but you might be more interested in a degree in computer science with a minor in statistics, mathematics, or distributed systems.

**Will you still want to do this in 5 years?**

[People most typically underestimate the amount they will change in the future.](http://www.danielgilbert.com/Quoidbach%20et%20al%202013.pdf) Acknowledge the very real possibility that in 3-5 years you will no longer want to be involved with Machine Learning. What then? This is a problem experienced by very many college/university students. Their chosen field isn’t what they thought it was, they find something better, the field suddenly becomes a graveyard. Anything can happen. So how should you account for this?

Thankfully, choosing to study a quantitative field like physics or mathematics offers a student *a lot* of flexibility in the kinds of work they can go into. The bottom line is that so many real world problems demand the kind of problem-solving and complex intellectual work trained in the former degrees. If you instead go into computer science as a path to Machine Learning, you can rest assured that if ML stops being your future that computer science degree offers someone a plethora of work opportunities in the software and computing industries.

**What can I study or work on now?**

The question of what to spend your time on before you’re even in university/college is a question of what maximises your future success in ML. As said above, focusing on current coursework in order to get into a top academic institution should be highest priority.  With that considered, starting personal projects related to ML can show that you are a self-starting, enthusiastic young student, which will play very well in freshman/1st year if you want to have a shot at getting a research assistant position or a 1st year internship.

## Getting Into ML: Engineers Guide

This is a guide for those that don’t need to find themselves in academic or industry research labs. This is a guide for those looking for work that’s currently most often described as [“ML Engineer”](https://www.spotifyjobs.com/job/machine-learning-engineer-ozhq4fwu/), [“ML Platform Engineer”](https://www.uber.com/en-AU/careers/list/31696/), [“ML Infrastructure Engineering”](https://www.quora.com/careers/software_engineer_machine_learning_infrastructure), “AI Engineer”, or even sometimes just “Data Engineer”. (((<---LINKS))) This kind of work is characterised by a close relationship with Machine Learning, ‘A.I’, and Analytics products and infrastructure. Engineers in this area are responsible for ‘productionising’ and ‘operationalising’ ML research and solutions. Often they work closely with researchers, without doing the ML model research and development themselves.

If you want to design ML architectures yourself, and publish papers on cutting-edge ML research, then you might prefer being an ML researcher. If your happy implementing and tweaking existing ML research, and designing the overall ‘ML system’, then an ML engineer will probably be a good fit for you. [Machine Learning: The High Interest Credit Card](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43146.html) showcases a number of challenges tackled by today’s and tomorrow’s ML engineers, while [Uber’s Michelangelo Project](https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/) showcases the kind of at-scale ML system you could build in congress with ML researchers.

Here are some examples of past and present ML engineers in industry

* [Erik Bernhardsson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikbern/) - Previous head of ML at Spotify, and organiser of New York’s ML Meetup.com meetup
* [Jeremy Hermann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyhermann/) - Head of Machine Learning Platform at Uber, and previous Head of Data Infrastructure
* [Reena Philip](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reenaphilip/) - Engineering Manager at Facebook Applied ML
* [Preston Parry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prestonparry/) - Senior Data Science Manager at Door Dash and Author of [auto_ml](https://github.com/ClimbsRocks/auto_ml)

Often there are people who mix research and engineering, having come from a research background and gradually taken on more engineering responsibility. For further exposition on the relationship between machine learning engineers and machine learning researcher, see [this Quora answer from a Data Science Manager at Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-machine-learning-engineer-and-a-data-scientist-at-Quora-Do-they-work-together-often-In-what-capacity).

**Education and Skills Requirements**

Although *a lot* of successful machine learning engineers seem to have graduate level education in a relevant field (statistics, com. sci. Distributed systems), it is not completely necessary for obtainment of a position nor success. Anecdotally, I’ve come across a number of high-ranking ML engineering professionals who seemingly learnt on the job, or moved from a related area of software engineering into ML as ML got more hyped.

If you don’t want to spend time in school, r/machinelearning’s [A Super Harsh Guide to Machine Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/5z8110/d_a_super_harsh_guide_to_machine_learning/)  is I think an excellently succinct and ‘no bullshit’ rant on on what it takes to be useful in the field. A lot of tutorials soft ball the demands of the field, making it seem like it’s not that hard to self-study yourself into a high-paying job in the hottest software discipline right now.

A robust machine learning engineering skill set is hard won, just like compilers, operating systems, or distributed systems skillsets. So while you (perhaps thankfully) don’t have to acquire a PHD, getting into ML engineering isn’t a walk in the park. Presented below is an inevitably incomplete, but still fleshed out list of resources for becoming an ML engineer.

## Getting Into ML: Researchers Guide

This guide is for those who want to go all the way. Machine Learning research positions are very highly competitive and are currently (and likely for the foreseeable future) flooded with PHD candidates. How you build your strategy for securing an ML research position will depend strongly on your previous/current education and your previous experience.

## **Education and Skills Requirements**

#### You have, or are currently in, a PHD

* **You already have a PHD in Machine Learning, Statistics, Computer Science**
    * You very likely don’t need this guide
* **You already have a PHD in a quantitative field, but not closely related to Machine Learning (eg. Economics)**
    * You will likely need to demonstrate your command of the Machine Learning field and ability to conduct research within it. The latter challenge is beyond the scope of this guide
* **You have a PHD in a non-quantitative field**
    * That program was likely not hugely contributive to Machine Learning unfortunately

#### You have, or are currently in, a Masters (research, not coursework)...

* **...in Machine Learning, Statistics, Computer Science**
    * If you don’t think you have demonstrated enough research ability during your Masters, a PHD might be in order. Otherwise, start applying!
* **...in a quantitative field, but not closely related to Machine Learning (eg. Economics)**
    * You will likely not be ready for a research position. PHD time?
* **…in a non-quantitative field**
    * That program was likely not hugely contributive to Machine Learning unfortunately

#### You have, or are currently in, an Undergraduate degree…

* **…in mathematics, statistics, physics**
    * This is a good start towards a research position in Machine Learning
* **…in Computer Science or Software Engineering**
    * This is a related area for Machine Learning, but research demands stronger skills in mathematics and statistics.
* **…in any other area**
    * You are not in, or do not have, a degree that contributes significantly to the skillset required for machine learning research. Consider swapping into one of the above, or if you’ve already finished consider a Masters + PHD in the above areas.

**Do You Really Need a PHD?**

In the vast majority of cases, yes, yes you do. Academic research teams will have a hard requirement on their members being Professors and Post-docs, and all good industry research teams (and even mediocre ones ((IBM))) can afford to source their team exclusively from PHD applicants.

To take the case of the Google Brain team, any budding researcher's dream gig. Google Brain is actually known for not requiring a candidate to have completed a PHD (Chris Olah doesn’t even have a BS Degree!), yet as of 2016 [78% of the Google Brain team had a PHD, with the majority of the rest having at least a Masters](http://jonathonbelotti.com/machine-learning/2016/08/13/google-brain-ama/).


**OK, So How Do I Get A PHD?**

## **Where do researchers go to work**

There are heaps of big software companies building Machine Learning research teams.

## Getting Into ML: Hacker Guide


Do you just want to tinker with Machine Learning (ML), build some cool shit with it, or just want to add some Machine Learning skills to your software development toolkit? This is the guide for you. It’s a guide for those not particularly concerned with studying to do research or to implement Machine Learning systems in industry.

**What to Learn**

In order to get some cool things out of today’s open-source machine learning ecosystem, you need to at least have a basic working knowledge of machine learning. There are a number of good blogs to introduce machine learning and AI to newcomers, a few of which are listed below.

**What can be made**

A good way to get new machine learning projects functional is to heavily follow and borrow from existing open-source project and solutions. Without a strong knowledge of the underlying theory, attempting any non-trivial project is likely to cause a lot of headaches. Here’s a number of cool open-sourced projects in a number of machine learning and AI areas to get your imagination going.
