An encouraging trend.

I've never read more books in a single year, and it feels good. I've continued to use reading to detach
my iPhone from my brain-stem, often carrying a book around and reading in short periods instead of fiddling
with my phone. I didn't play video games at all this year, replacing it with reading â€“ keen to play a little next year though, if the new PS5 games are good.
After three years of consistent reading, I feel like I've made significant progress breaking out of ['the shallows'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shallows_(book)).

To cap off the year of reading. Here's some simple stats/facts:

* Worst book: _100 Plus_
* 11,800+ pages, apparently 
* 11/38 from women authors (gf rightly nags me about this)
* 18/38 second hand books

I read a lot of famous and well regarded books this year, and they were so good I couldn't pick a favourite.
That said, these are a top 5 in terms of how much they durably affected my emotions and thinking.

* The Grapes of Wrath
* The Cathedral & the Bazaar: Musing on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary
* The Nickel Boys
* Debt: The First 5,000 years
* Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind The Rise of the Radical Right
