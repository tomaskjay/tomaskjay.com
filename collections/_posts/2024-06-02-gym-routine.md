Not going to pretend like I'm Arnold Schwarzenegger or anything but just a few tips: consistency is the most important thing hereâ€”a bad day at the gym is better than a skipped day (you can even walk into the gym just to stretch). And eat a lot, but eat well. Also, don't forget to work on mobility. You don't want to be [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj2yfvQGbl8).
