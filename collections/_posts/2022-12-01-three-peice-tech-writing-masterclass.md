The title of this is a dig at the ‚Äòget smart quick‚Äô scheme peddled by [Masterclass.com](http://Masterclass.com), but the post itself exists to share the three best pieces of technical writing infotainment that I know. I‚Äôve recommended this stuff to many, many software engineers in the past two years, in 1on1s and during the design docs onboarding session that I used to run at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

Engaging with these three things ‚Äî a lecture, a podcast, and a website ‚Äî can create a spark of new perspective on what writing is for and how you can better use it in your work. They won‚Äôt make you a good technical writer, for that you merely need hundreds of hours of practice, but they should grab you by the shoulders and push you down a path to better writing and happier readers.

## A lecture: Writing beyond the academy, _University of Chicago Writing Program_

<code style="background-color: white;">link:</code> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwVf5a3pZM">youtube.com/watch?v=aFwVf5a3pZM</a>

> ‚ÄúThe most important thing about your writing _is that it be valuable_, and I would argue that not only have you not learned how to do this, you‚Äôve learned habits that work _against_ your ability to make your writing valuable.‚Äù

You know people who are so keen to have you read something, or play something, or watch something, that they become annoying? That‚Äôs me with this lecture.

The lecture is given by Larry McErnerney in the best kind of professory fashion. He‚Äôs confident, didactic, dramatic, and passionate. He‚Äôs also offering the most exciting kind of lecture: the lecture that tells you "everything you‚Äôve been taught is wrong, but I have here this red pill‚Ä¶"

Watch this, and then keep rewatching until adherence to its edicts is your default setting.

## A podcast: Writing, Technically _with James Somers_

<code style="background-color: white;">link:</code> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://signalsandthreads.com/writing-technically/">signalsandthreads.com/writing-technically/</a>

This episode is from the _Signals and Threads_ podcast, possibly the best software engineering podcast besides _On The Metal_. In it you spend one hour with James Somers and Ron Minsky exploring the pleasure and the purpose of technical writing.

James Somers is an uncommonly strong combo of writer and programmer. His day job is at Jane Street, and in his spare time he contributes articles to [_The New Yorker_ (and The Atlantic)](https://jsomers.net/).

The host, Jane Street CTO Ron Minsky, brings his typical depth of knowledge and care to the topic, and so the two combine to provide the best discussion of writing in the software industry that I think you‚Äôll find. Writing used to seem like a chore to me, but conversations like this have moved me to start seeing writing as just as enjoyable and worthy as typing out programs in code.

Highlights of this include the discussion of ‚Äòself-documenting‚Äô code, the notion of _genre_ in technical writing, and the episode‚Äôs coda, which shares one man's success using prose to categorize the scale of wind.

## A website: The Documentation System

> The Grand Unified Theory of Documentation - David Laing

This third piece of the puzzle is likely familiar to you: Divio and their 4-types documentation framework.

To me the core lesson of this framework is that each technical document you write exists to solve a practical problem of a particular reader. As is appropriately hammered home by Larry in the lecture, your writing must be _valuable_, and solving the problems of others is exactly that.

Documents which aren‚Äôt written with an eye on this framework hurt the writer and the reader. For the writer, the selection of a document type narrows you in while creating and makes review and edit more straightforward. For the reader, documentation which breaks down into familiar types is much easier to navigate and digest. As a simple example, the experienced React core contributor is not looking for React tutorials, and the web newbie is not initially looking for React's API references.

## That‚Äôs it

Now go and get into them! Enjoy your Masterclass üçø
